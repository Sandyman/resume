				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I value freedom, honesty, and transparency. I believe in self-organisation over command & control, open communication over hierarchy, and using common sense over blindly following procedures. I keep developing myself by staying up to date with modern practices, in the realms of software engineering and of business and organisations.</p>

					<h2>Owner of Sander Huijsen Software Development & Organisational Management</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">October 2016 - Present</p>
					<p>Software development and organisational management. Helping you face the challenges the 21st century brings you. Is your organisation resilient and flexible? I can also help you build great software, having long-standing experience in the field. Do you need someone for your embedded software, or your Cloud implementation? Contact me!

				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Sr. Software Developer at Imdex Limited</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">January 2015 - September 2017</p>
					<p>As Senior Software Engineer, I was a member of a multi-disciplinary team and responsible for writing and maintaining firmware for downhole instrumentation (various microcontrollers) and Android software running on a ruggedised tablet. I've worked on a project utilizing a Raspberry Pi using C#, and later worked on moving the product toward a true embedded platform (C). I usually work closely with hardware engineers. Having a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering makes this almost second nature to me. I have applied various Management 3.0 techniques, e.g., for retrospective meetings, and I am an advocate of Agile (e.g., Scrum).</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Sr. Software Developer at Devisd</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">March 2014 - January 2015</p>
					<p>As Senior Software Engineer, I played an important role in a small team creating a web application written in PHP/JavaScript/jQuery/HTML/CSS/jQuery, and running on an nginx Linux server with a PostgreSQL database. I have contributed to the web app and to a number of scripts, either for directly supporting the web app, or for interfacing to other websites. The web app runs on an EC2 instance (Amazon Web Services) and is backed by a PostgreSQL database (also AWS).</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Self-employed ScrumMaster / Software Developer at Imagile</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">March 2012 - January 2014</p>
					<p>As a self-employed ScrumMaster (or Iteration Manager), I aimed to help my clients achieve their software goals, naturally in an Agile fashion. This includes but was not limited to Scrum and Kanban. I offered courses in the field of agile, for example, “Scrum-in-one-day”, “Story Mapping” and “Lean Startup”. I worked as ScrumMaster for one of the Netherlands' biggest airline operators.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Trainer Agile / Sr. Software Developer at Logica</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">September 2010 - June 2012</p>
					<p>I operated as a trainer for the Logica internal training ‘Agile Scrum for project managers’. I was co-author of the training material for this course and provided the Agile Scrum training for all Logica locations. I also held various software development roles.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Sr. Software Developer TA Team</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">June 2005 - August 2010</p>
					<p>I worked for several clients of TA Team as a Senior Software Developer. It was also the first company were I experienced Agile in practice, something I have pursued every since.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Firmware Developer at Conexant</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">March 2002 - June 2006</p>
					<p>I worked in both the Maintenance team, responsible for maintaining and improving existing 802.11 ("WiFi") products, and the Core firmware team responsible for developing the new firmware for 802.11 products, both WiFi access points and clients. I worked on low-level firmware (controlling the hardware) and on higher-level applications, e.g., daemons, such as the Inter-Access Point Protocol and the implementation of Cisco Client Extensions, Time Slicing and Virtual AP.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Software Developer at Frontier Design</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">March 2000 - March 2002</p>
					<p>Frontier Design’s core business was the development of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks for ASIC and FPGA, which could be used by customers as macro blocks. I made a significant contribution during the definition phase of an innovative speech recognition system that was to be integrated in an existing PABX. I also made major improvements to an ADPCM codec so that more channels were available and a higher clock frequency could be used, and co-developed tamLIB, a special ‘telephone answering machine’ library developed for GenDSP.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Software Developer at Altium</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">November 1997 - March 2000</p>
					<p>I worked on the development of the complete development environment for a newly developed 32-bit DSP, named Carmel. This DSP was developed by an Israeli firm in cooperation with Infineon. I contributed to the development of the assembler and the debugger. The Israeli company created a plug-in which had to be integrated with the debugger, for which I was responsible. To support the DSP, I developed a ‘fast floating point’ library, for which I utilized specific features of the processor such as ‘delay slots’. I also worked on a proof of concept regarding ‘software pipelining’ by applying loop unfolding.</p>

				<h1>Endorsements</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Craig Drayton</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Mazzlo</p>
					<p>Sander was contracted by Mazzlo to develop several services to replace and extend an existing backend. The new services, written with Node.js and the Serverless Framework, improved the functionality, scalability and performance of the existing application.
						<br/><br/>
						The codebase, the domain and the APIs Sander needed to work with were complex. Sander worked tirelessly to grasp this context and was quickly able to start adding value and moving the product (and business) forward.
						<br/><br/>
						Sander's working style is open and humble. Despite working remotely, I always felt connected to what was going on - and could trust Sander to communicate clearly about both the successes and challenges.
						<br/><br/>
						Sander helped move my business forward, and it was a pleasure to work with along the way - I can happily recommend him to others.

					<h2>Marks Banks</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Imdex Limited</p>
					<p>Sander came on board the company in a period of internal growth to our software engineering team and in a short space of time had mastered a complex firmware product, became someone who could be trusted to get the job done and enabled continued improvement through agile process.
                        <br/><br/>
                        He also became fluent in mobile app development for Android and a senior developer who others in my team relied on for objective and seasoned advice.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I respect Sander greatly for his courage in challenging existing ways of doing things and has always shown a genuine desire to learn better ways to produce software himself and collaborating with other team members.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Based on my experience managing Sander, anyone who has the opportunity to work with Sander will become more well rounded as a result.</p>
